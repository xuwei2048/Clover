**Clover** is an open-source UEFI boot manager, primarily used for booting macOS (formerly known as OS X) on non-Apple computers (known as "Hackintoshes"). Clover features a graphical user interface (based off [rEFIt](http://refit.sourceforge.net/)), with support for booting Windows, Linux, and other UEFI-based operating systems and images.  Clover is compatible with UEFI-based computers, as well as legacy BIOS-based computers (using [DUET](https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/DuetPkg) for UEFI emulation).
